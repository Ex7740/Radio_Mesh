# Radio Mesh

A custom mesh network utilising 2.4GHz radio nodes using microcontrollers and nrf24l01

There are 3 types of node:

-Basic node: Simply just the microcontroller and nrf24l01 modules 
-Sensor node: More complex, Houses the microcontroller and nrf24l01, plus a varity of sensors, dependant on the application
-Storage node: Houses a Flash chip to hold sensor data and other data
